# TAMIZH-TAMIL-Language-SPEECH-TO-TEXT
The project "Tamil Speech to Text" is a web-based application developed by Group 1 at UWE, Bristol, designed to convert spoken Tamil into written Tamil text. Its primary aim is to help native and diaspora Tamil speakers with accurate pronunciation and language preservation through a simple, user-friendly interface.
